        "How it works: L2 regularization adds the squared values of the coefficients to the loss function. The penalty term is the sum of the squared values of the weights, scaled by a regularization parameter (λ).\n",
        "Effect: It discourages large weights but doesn’t force them to become exactly zero, unlike L1 regularization. This helps the model avoid overfitting by keeping the model's coefficients smaller and more stable.\n",
